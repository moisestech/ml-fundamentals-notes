## 1. Lesson Outline

Welcome to the introduction to machine learning lesson!

Machine learning is creating rapid and exciting changes across all levels of society.

It is the engine behind the recent advancements in industries such as autonomous vehicles.
It allows for more accurate and rapid translation of the text into hundreds of languages.
It powers the AI assistants you might find in your home.
It can help improve worker safety.
It can speed up drug design.
Machine learning is a complex subject area. Our goal in this lesson is to introduce you to some of the most common terms and ideas used in machine learning. I will then walk you through the different steps involved in machine learning and finish with a series of examples that use machine learning to solve real-world situations.

Let's look at how the lesson outline.

### Lesson Outline

- This lesson is divided into the following sections:

- First, we'll discuss what machine learning is, common terminology, and common components involved in creating a machine learning project.
- Next, we'll step into the shoes of a machine learning practitioner.
  - **Machine learning involves using trained models to generate predictions and detect patterns from data**.
  - To understand the process, we'll break down the different steps involved and examine a common process that applies to the majority of machine learning projects.
- Finally, we'll take you through **three examples using the steps we described to solve real-life scenarios** that might be faced by machine learning practitioners.
