### **1. True or False: All problems where you're trying to predict some value can be solved with machine learning.**

- [ ] True. You might have to get pretty clever with how you use machine learning in some cases, but all predictions can be solved with machine learning.

- [ ] False. In some situations, you fundamentally do not have enough information to make an accurate prediciton with any technique, including machine learning.

### **2. What are hyperparameters?**

- [ ] Model parameters that change faster than most other model paramters during model training.
- [ ] Model paramters that have more of an impact on the final result than most other model parameters.
- [ ] Parameters within a model inference algorithm.
- [ ] Parameters which affect model training but typically cannot be incrementally adjusted like other paramters as part of model training.

### **3. Which of the following is the best explanation for how a model trainig algorithm works?**

- [ ] Model training algorithms incrementally adjust model parameters to minimize some loss function.
- [ ] Model training algorithms slowly add or remove model parameters until the model fits the dataset it was trained on.
- [ ] Model trainign algorithms train a separate model for each data point and then picks the one with the lowest function.
- [ ] Model training algorithms are used on a prepared machine learning model to make predictions on n ewn unseen data.

### **4. Which of the following would not be a good reason to us a linear model?**

- [ ] I am not yet sure what model would work well with my data, and I want to establish a quick baseline.
- [ ] The input-output relationships I'm trying to model look like they're pretty straightforward.. When plotting my label as a function of each of my input variables. I can see that fitting a line would do better than randomly guessing in many cases.
- [ ] Linear models worked for most other problems I've tacked before, so it should definately work well for my current challenge.
- [ ] I'm still early on in building my understanding of machine learning and want to start with something I can easily understand and visualize.
