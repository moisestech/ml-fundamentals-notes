### **1. True or False: All problems where you're trying to predict some value can be solved with machine learning.**

- [ ] True. You might have to get pretty clever with how you use machine learning in some cases, but all predictions can be solved with machine learning.

- [ ] False. In some situations, you fundamentally do not have enough information to make an accurate prediciton with any technique, including machine learning.

---

### **2. What are hyperparameters?**

- [ ] Model parameters that change faster than most other model paramters during model training.
- [ ] Model paramters that have more of an impact on the final result than most other model parameters.
- [ ] Parameters within a model inference algorithm.
- [ ] Parameters which affect model training but typically cannot be incrementally adjusted like other paramters as part of model training.

---

### **3. Which of the following is the best explanation for how a model trainig algorithm works?**

- [ ] Model training algorithms incrementally adjust model parameters to minimize some loss function.
- [ ] Model training algorithms slowly add or remove model parameters until the model fits the dataset it was trained on.
- [ ] Model trainign algorithms train a separate model for each data point and then picks the one with the lowest function.
- [ ] Model training algorithms are used on a prepared machine learning model to make predictions on n ewn unseen data.

### **4. Which of the following would not be a good reason to us a linear model?**

- [ ] I am not yet sure what model would work well with my data, and I want to establish a quick baseline.
- [ ] The input-output relationships I'm trying to model look like they're pretty straightforward.. When plotting my label as a function of each of my input variables. I can see that fitting a line would do better than randomly guessing in many cases.
- [ ] Linear models worked for most other problems I've tacked before, so it should definately work well for my current challenge.
- [ ] I'm still early on in building my understanding of machine learning and want to start with something I can easily understand and visualize.

### **5. What is a machine learning model?**

- [ ] Generic program, made specific by data.
- [ ] A set of high-level statistics and visualizations that help you understand the shape of your data.
- [ ] A linear function.

### **6. Which of the following is not a model evaluation metric?**

- [ ] Root Mean Square (RMS)
- [ ] Model Inference Algorithm
- [ ] Silhouette Coefficient
- [ ] Accuracy

### **7. Your friend suggests you should ranfomize the order of your data before splitting into a training and test dataset is your friend right?**

- [ ] No, your friend is not right. There is no benefit to doing this, and the detail just makes the process too complex.
- [ ] No, your friend is not right. You should make sure your work is always repeatable, and there is no way to gt repeatability if you randomly reorder the dataset.
- [ ] Yes, your friend is right. It is possible your data was originally organized in such a way that splitting will give the model a biased view of the dataset (imagine for example if all the data was ordered by some feature)

### **8. Let's say you're trying to cluster anonymized foot traffic locatin data to determine common "downtown" hubs in a city. You're confident hubs will show up as tight clusters, so you're surprised when you first approach misses certain clusters you know should exist. What should you do?**

- [ ] Check the dataset to test your assumptions, is the data well-formatted? Does the data effectively represent the real world? For example, do you have data in the missing clusters?
- [ ] Inspect the model to test your assumptions. Does your model contain assumptions about how the data is organized? For example, does the model assume all clusters are the same size? How does the model handle clusters that are very close to each other?
- [ ] Inspect your model evaluation mechanism to ensure you're asking the right questions. Is your evaluation mechnism's definition of a "better" model aligned with the problem you're trying to solve?
- [ ] All of these answers.

---

### **9. Let's say you're trying to predict a child's show size from their age and parent's show sizes. You relax the problem to allow for predictions between shoe sizes. What kind of machine learning task would you use to represent this problem?**

- [ ] Regression
- [ ] Classification
- [ ] Reinforcement Learning
- [ ] Clustering

---

### **10. Is model accuracy sufficient to use in all cases?**

- [ ] Yes. By definition, it's measuring how good your model is at making predictions.
- [ ] No, You might care more about some predictions than others, and model accuracy treats all predictions as the same.

---

### **11. What is the definition of model accuracy?**

- [ ] How of your model makes a correct prediction.
- [ ] How often your model makes similar predictions.
