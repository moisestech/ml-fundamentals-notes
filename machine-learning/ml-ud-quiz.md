### **1. True or False: All problems where you're trying to predict some value can be solved with machine learning.**

- [ ] True. You might have to get pretty clever with how you use machine learning in some cases, but all predictions can be solved with machine learning.

- [ ] False. In some situations, you fundamentally do not have enough information to make an accurate prediciton with any technique, including machine learning.

### **What are hyperparameters?**

- [ ] Model parameters that change faster than most other model paramters during model training.
- [ ] Model paramters that have more of an impact on the final result than most other model parameters.
- [ ] Parameters within a model inference algorithm.
- [ ] Parameters which affect model training but typically cannot be incrementally adjusted like other paramters as part of model training.

### **Which of the following is the best explanation for how a model trainig algorithm works?**

- [ ] Model training algorithms incrementally adjust model parameters to minimize some loss function.
- [ ] Model training algorithms slowly add or remove model parameters until the model fits the dataset it was trained on.
- [ ] Model trainign algorithms train a separate model for each data point and then picks the one with the lowest function.
- [ ] Model training algorithms are used on a prepared machine learning model to make predictions on n ewn unseen data.
