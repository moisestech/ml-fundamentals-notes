## Supervised Machine Learning

### Classfication

- Classification Supervised Machine Learning uses **an algorithm to accurately assign test data into specific categories**.

  - It **recognizes specific entities within the dataset** and attempts to **draw some conclusions on how those entities should be labeled** or defined.

### Regression

- Regression Supervised Machine Learnin is **used to understand the relationship between dependent and independent variables**.

  - It is commonly used to make projections, such as for sales revenue for a given business.
