## **10. Word Embeddings**

🎥 [Udacity, Video Link](https://youtu.be/xQzKJgNQRK0)

Embeddings are clusters of vectors in multi-dimensional space, where each vector represents a given word in those dimensions. While it’s difficult for us humans to think in many dimensions, luckily the TensorFlow Projector makes it fairly easy for us to view these clusters in a 3D projection (later Colabs will generate the necessary files for use with the projection tool).

This can be very useful for sentiment analysis models, where you’d expect to see clusters around either more positive or more negative sentiment associated with each word.

An example embedding projection, post-training. Negative sentiment words are separated quite distinctly from positive sentiment words, such as “incredible”.

QUIZ QUESTION

SENTIMENT

Amazing

Dog

## **11. Building a Basic Sentiment Model**

🎥 [Udacity, Video Link](https://youtu.be/-g5Tqsna8yE)

We’ve given you the code to create the files for input into the projector. This will download two files: 1) the vectors, and 2) the metadata.

The projector will already come with a pre-loaded visualization, so you’ll need to use the “Load” button on the left and upload each of the two files. In some cases, there may be a small difference in the number of tensors present in the vector file and the metadata file (usually with a message appearing after uploading the metadata); if this appears, wait for a few seconds for the error message to disappear, and then click outside the window. Typically, the visualization will still load just fine.

Make sure to click the checkbox for “Sphereize data”, which will better show whether there is separation between positive and negative sentiment (or not).

## **14. Tweaking the Model**

🎥 [Udacity, Video Link](https://youtu.be/pW8db9sLRbM)

There are a number of ways in which you might improve the sentiment analysis model we’ve built already:

Data and preprocessing-based approaches
More data
Adjusting vocabulary size (make sure to consider the overall size of the corpus!)
Adjusting sequence length (more or less padding or truncation)
Whether to pad or truncate pre or post (usually less of an effect than the others)
Model-based approaches
Adjust the number of embedding dimensions
Changing use of Flatten vs. GlobalAveragePooling1D
Considering other layers like Dropout
Adjusting the number of nodes in intermediate fully-connected layers
These are just some of the potential things you might tweak to better predict sentiment from text.

Tweaking the Model Quiz
Even with these potential tweaks, do you think there is anything the models still are missing that could improve performance?

## **16. What's in a (sub)word?**

🎥 [Udacity, Video Link](https://youtu.be/A_F5ZcQzid0)
We’ve worked with full words before for our sentiment models, and Jocelyn had shown us some issues right at the start of the lesson when using character-based tokenization. Subwords are another approach, where individual words are broken up into the more commonly appearing pieces of themselves. This helps avoid marking very rare words as OOV when you use only the most common words in a corpus.

As shown in the video, this can further expose an issue affecting all of our models up to this point, in that they don’t understand the full context of the sequence of words in an input. The next lesson on recurrent neural networks will help address this issue.

The example subwords from the video breaking out Decent, Decadent and Decay.
Our example subwords using Decent, Decadent and Decay.

Subword Datasets
There are a number of already created subwords datasets available online. If you check out the IMDB dataset on TFDS, for instance, by scrolling down you can see datasets with both 8,000 subwords as well as 32,000 subwords in a corpus (along with regular full-word datasets).

However, I want you to know how to create these yourself as well, so we’ll use TensorFlow’s SubwordTextEncoder and its build_from_corpus function to create one from the reviews dataset we used previously.

QUIZ QUESTION
Subwords are:

Pieces of words, often made up of smaller words, that make words with similar roots be tokenized more similarly.

Further Research
If you’re interested in more work with subwords, there’s an unofficial Google repository called SentencePiece that contains some interesting techniques for improved creation of the subwords dataset from an original text dataset.

## **18. Lesson Conclusion**

🎥 [Udacity, Video Link](https://youtu.be/rwIF6t4CFFg)
You’ve already learned an amazing amount of material on Natural Language Processing with TensorFlow in this lesson.

You started with Tokenization by:

Tokenizing input text
Creating and padding sequences
Incorporating out of vocabulary words
Generalizing tokenization and sequence methods to real world datasets
From there, you moved onto Embeddings, where you:

transformed tokenized sequences into embeddings
developed a basic sentiment analysis model
visualized the embeddings vector
tweaked hyperparameters of the model to improve it
and diagnosed potential issues with using pre-trained subword tokenizers when the network doesn’t have sequence context
In the next lesson, you’ll dive into Recurrent Neural Networks, which will be able to understand the sequence of inputs, and you'll learn how to generate new text.
