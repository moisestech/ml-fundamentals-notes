Lesson Outline

In the first lesson on Natural Language Processing with TensorFlow, we‚Äôll focus on Tokenization and Embeddings, which will help convert input text into useful data for input into the neural network layers you‚Äôve seen before.

In the second lesson, we‚Äôll dive into Recurrent Neural Networks (such as the LSTMs you saw in the Time Series Analysis lesson) as well as Text Generation, which allows for the creation of new text.

## **4. Tokenizing Text**

üé• [Udacity, Video Link](https://youtu.be/7u_ZUlh4gu0)

Neural networks utilize numbers as their inputs, so we need to convert our input text into numbers. Tokenization is the process of assigning numbers to our inputs, but there is more than one way to do this - should each letter have its own numerical token, each word, phrase, etc.

As you saw in the video, tokenizing based on letters with our current neural networks doesn‚Äôt always work so well - anagrams, for instance, may be made up of the same letters but have vastly different meanings. So, in our case, we‚Äôll start by tokenizing each individual word.

Tokenizer
With TensorFlow, this is done easily through use of a Tokenizer, found within tf.keras.preprocessing.text. If you wanted only the first 10 most common words, you could initialize it like so:

tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=10)
Fit on Texts
Then, to fit the tokenizer to your inputs (in the below case a list of strings called sentences), you use .fit_on_texts():

tokenizer.fit_on_texts(sentences)
Text to Sequences
From there, you can use the tokenizer to convert sentences into tokenized sequences:

tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(sentences)
Out of Vocabulary Words
However, new sentences may have new words that the tokenizer was not fit on. By default, the tokenizer will just ignore these words and not include them in the tokenized sequences. However, you can also add an ‚Äúout of vocabulary‚Äù, or OOV, token to represent these words. This has to be specified when originally creating the Tokenizer object.

tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=20, oov_token=‚ÄôOOV‚Äô)
Viewing the Word Index
Lastly, if you want to see how the tokenizer has mapped numbers to words, use the tokenizer.word_index property to see this mapping.

QUESTION 1 OF 2
Match the different words below that would have the exact same letter-based embeddings. As a hint, look for words that are anagrams.

WORD 1

WORD 2

silent

burned

infests

looped

QUESTION 2 OF 2
Which of the following would be an appropriate tokenization of the below two sentences?

The person ran quickly.

The car drove quickly to the bank.

Further Research
Many NLP models get trained on very large text corpuses to avoid having too many OOV words. Below are a couple of great resources for finding datasets that you might find useful on your NLP journey:

## **6. Text to Sequences**

Even after converting sentences to numerical values, there‚Äôs still an issue of providing equal length inputs to our neural networks - not every sentence will be the same length!

There‚Äôs two main ways you can process the input sentences to achieve this - padding the shorter sentences with zeroes, and truncating some of the longer sequences to be shorter. In fact, you‚Äôll likely use some combination of these.

With TensorFlow, the pad_sequences function from tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence can be used for both of these tasks. Given a list of sequences, you can specify a maxlen (where any sequences longer than that will be cut shorter), as well as whether to pad and truncate from either the beginning or ending, depending on pre or post settings for the padding and truncating arguments. By default, padding and truncation will happen from the beginning of the sequence, so set these to post if you want it to occur at the end of the sequence.

If you wanted to pad and truncate from the beginning, you could use the following:

padded = pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen=10)

## **8. Tokenization of Large Datasets**

üé• [Udacity, Video Link](https://youtu.be/hPLWdUmtuwM)

Everything you have learned previously applies fairly similarly to larger datasets. In many cases, you‚Äôll want to be even more focused on the total number of words used with the Tokenizer, as well as understanding the right sequence length to create from pad_sequences.

In the upcoming Colab, we‚Äôll use portions of a Sentiment Analysis Dataset on Kaggle that contains both Amazon product and Yelp restaurant reviews.

QUIZ QUESTION
When specifying num_words in the Tokenizer, if set at 1,000:

Only the most common 1,000 words are kept

Further Research
Once again, it can be useful to check out Google‚Äôs Dataset Search to find large datasets to work with, and Kaggle also has a wide variety of datasets available for use.

## **10. Word Embeddings**

üé• [Udacity, Video Link](https://youtu.be/xQzKJgNQRK0)

Embeddings are clusters of vectors in multi-dimensional space, where each vector represents a given word in those dimensions. While it‚Äôs difficult for us humans to think in many dimensions, luckily the TensorFlow Projector makes it fairly easy for us to view these clusters in a 3D projection (later Colabs will generate the necessary files for use with the projection tool).

This can be very useful for sentiment analysis models, where you‚Äôd expect to see clusters around either more positive or more negative sentiment associated with each word.

An example embedding projection, post-training. Negative sentiment words are separated quite distinctly from positive sentiment words, such as ‚Äúincredible‚Äù.

## **11. Building a Basic Sentiment Model**

üé• [Udacity, Video Link](https://youtu.be/-g5Tqsna8yE)

We‚Äôve given you the code to create the files for input into the projector. This will download two files: 1) the vectors, and 2) the metadata.

The projector will already come with a pre-loaded visualization, so you‚Äôll need to use the ‚ÄúLoad‚Äù button on the left and upload each of the two files. In some cases, there may be a small difference in the number of tensors present in the vector file and the metadata file (usually with a message appearing after uploading the metadata); if this appears, wait for a few seconds for the error message to disappear, and then click outside the window. Typically, the visualization will still load just fine.

Make sure to click the checkbox for ‚ÄúSphereize data‚Äù, which will better show whether there is separation between positive and negative sentiment (or not).

## **14. Tweaking the Model**

üé• [Udacity, Video Link](https://youtu.be/pW8db9sLRbM)

There are a number of ways in which you might improve the sentiment analysis model we‚Äôve built already:

Data and preprocessing-based approaches
More data
Adjusting vocabulary size (make sure to consider the overall size of the corpus!)
Adjusting sequence length (more or less padding or truncation)
Whether to pad or truncate pre or post (usually less of an effect than the others)
Model-based approaches
Adjust the number of embedding dimensions
Changing use of Flatten vs. GlobalAveragePooling1D
Considering other layers like Dropout
Adjusting the number of nodes in intermediate fully-connected layers
These are just some of the potential things you might tweak to better predict sentiment from text.

Tweaking the Model Quiz
Even with these potential tweaks, do you think there is anything the models still are missing that could improve performance?

## **16. What's in a (sub)word?**

üé• [Udacity, Video Link](https://youtu.be/A_F5ZcQzid0)
We‚Äôve worked with full words before for our sentiment models, and Jocelyn had shown us some issues right at the start of the lesson when using character-based tokenization. Subwords are another approach, where individual words are broken up into the more commonly appearing pieces of themselves. This helps avoid marking very rare words as OOV when you use only the most common words in a corpus.

As shown in the video, this can further expose an issue affecting all of our models up to this point, in that they don‚Äôt understand the full context of the sequence of words in an input. The next lesson on recurrent neural networks will help address this issue.

The example subwords from the video breaking out Decent, Decadent and Decay.
Our example subwords using Decent, Decadent and Decay.

Subword Datasets
There are a number of already created subwords datasets available online. If you check out the IMDB dataset on TFDS, for instance, by scrolling down you can see datasets with both 8,000 subwords as well as 32,000 subwords in a corpus (along with regular full-word datasets).

However, I want you to know how to create these yourself as well, so we‚Äôll use TensorFlow‚Äôs SubwordTextEncoder and its build_from_corpus function to create one from the reviews dataset we used previously.

QUIZ QUESTION
Subwords are:

Pieces of words, often made up of smaller words, that make words with similar roots be tokenized more similarly.

Further Research
If you‚Äôre interested in more work with subwords, there‚Äôs an unofficial Google repository called SentencePiece that contains some interesting techniques for improved creation of the subwords dataset from an original text dataset.

## **18. Lesson Conclusion**

üé• [Udacity, Video Link](https://youtu.be/rwIF6t4CFFg)
You‚Äôve already learned an amazing amount of material on Natural Language Processing with TensorFlow in this lesson.

You started with Tokenization by:

Tokenizing input text
Creating and padding sequences
Incorporating out of vocabulary words
Generalizing tokenization and sequence methods to real world datasets
From there, you moved onto Embeddings, where you:

transformed tokenized sequences into embeddings
developed a basic sentiment analysis model
visualized the embeddings vector
tweaked hyperparameters of the model to improve it
and diagnosed potential issues with using pre-trained subword tokenizers when the network doesn‚Äôt have sequence context
In the next lesson, you‚Äôll dive into Recurrent Neural Networks, which will be able to understand the sequence of inputs, and you'll learn how to generate new text.
