QUESTION 1 OF 2
Given a convolutional layer with dimensions d x h x w = (20*8*8), what length will one row of the vectorized convolutional layer have? (Vectorized means that the spatial dimensions are flattened.)

64

QUESTION 2 OF 2
Given a convolutional layer with dimensions d x h x w = (20*8*8), what dimensions (h x w) will the resultant Gram matrix have?

(20 x 20)

## **8. Notebook: Style Transfer**

Notebook: Style Transfer
Now, you're ready to implement style transfer and apply it using your own images!

It's suggested that you open the notebook in a new, working tab and continue working on it as you go through the instructional videos in this tab. This way you can toggle between learning new skills and coding/applying new skills.

To open this notebook, go your local repo (from here on Github) and open the notebook Style_Transfer_Exercise.ipynb in the style-transfer folder. You can either download the repository with git clone [](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git), or download it as an archive file from this link.

### Instructions

Load in a pre-trained VGG Net
Freeze the weights in selected layers, so that the model can be used as a fixed feature extractor
Load in content and style images
Extract features from different layers of our model
Complete a function to calculate the gram matrix of a given convolutional layer
Define the content, style, and total loss for iteratively updating a target image
This is a self-assessed lab. If you need any help or want to check your answers, feel free to check out the solutions notebook in the same folder, or by clicking here.

### Note about GPUs

In this notebook, you'll find optimizing the image is much faster if you use a GPU. However, you can still complete the exercises without a GPU. If you can't use a local GPU, we suggest you use cloud platforms such as AWS, GCP, and FloydHub to train your networks on a GPU.
