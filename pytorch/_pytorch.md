# PyTorch

## Lesson 1: Intro

### Course overview

- We've built this course as an introduction to deep learning. Deep learning is a field of machine learning utilizing massive neural networks, massive datasets, and accelerated computing on GPUs.

  - Many of the advancements we've seen in AI recently are due to the power of deep learning. This revolution is impacting a wide range of industries already with applications such as personal voice assistants, medical imaging, automated vehicles, video game AI, and more.

- In this course, we'll be covering the concepts behind deep learning and how to build deep learning models using PyTorch.
  - We've included a lot of hands-on exercises so by the end of the course, you'll be defining and training your own state-of-the-art deep learning models.

### PyTorch Library

- PyTorch is an open-source Python framework from the Facebook AI Research team used for developing deep neural networks.
  - I like to think of PyTorch as an extension of Numpy that has some convenience classes for defining neural networks and accelerated computations using GPUs.
  - PyTorch is designed with a Python-first philosophy, it follows Python conventions and idioms, and works perfectly alongside popular Python packages.
